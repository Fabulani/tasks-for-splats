# Tasks for Splats

> Making Gaussian Splatting research repos easier to set up and use, one Dockerfile at a time.

This is a multi-project repository focusing on making Gaussian Splatting research repositories easier to set up and use. I use [Tasks](https://taskfile.dev/) and Docker for setting everything up, with Github Container Registry for housing the built images.

Currently, the following projects are available:

| **task**                             | **category**                        | **status** | **note**                                             | **link**                                                                                                                                                  |

## Pre-requisites

Install [Tasks](https://taskfile.dev/installation/) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

## Setup

Duplicate/rename `.env.example` to `.env`, and add the path to your datasets folder, e.g.:

```txt
DATA_PATH="//c/path/to/datasets"
```

This path will be bound to a docker volume and become available inside the containers `data` folder.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> On Windows, the path must start with two forward slashes (/). For a path in the C drive: "//c/path/to/datasets"

## Usage

Type `task` to see all available tasks and their descriptions. For `.env` to work, run all tasks from the main root Taskfile.

To work on a specific project, run the tasks associated with that project. For example, with `gsplat`, the following should be enough:

```bash
task gsplat:pull
task gsplat:run
```

These will pull the image, run the container, and exec into it. Every project has this set of tasks: `clone`, `build`, `pull`, `push`, and `run`.

> [!NOTE]
> Read the README.md in each project for project-specific instructions.

The `-all` tasks are for batch execution of tasks from all projects. For example, to clone all repositories:

```bash
task clone-all
```

## Development

Adding new projects follows this workflow:

0. Create and checkout a new branch.
1. Create a folder for the project using the template `.templates/project`. Project folders usually contain the following:

   ```txt
   project_name/
   â””â”€â”€ docker/
      â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml
      â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile
   â””â”€â”€ README.md
   â””â”€â”€ Taskfile.yaml
   ```

2. Rename and edit the template files.
3. Additional files needed for the container go inside the project `docker` folder.
4. Check that all tasks from the new project work.
5. Open a PR and wait for the merge!
